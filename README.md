# 🏠 Loan Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Loan Prediction** repository! This project uses machine learning to predict loan approval based on applicant data. The analysis is conducted using Python, with the main work done in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📖 Introduction

Loan approval prediction is a critical task in the finance industry. This project aims to build a predictive model that helps banks and financial institutions assess the likelihood of a loan being approved based on various applicant features.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the loan application dataset to ensure accurate model predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various classification algorithms to predict loan approval status.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize important trends and insights from the data to support decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The analysis is based on the **Loan Prediction Dataset** provided in this repository. The dataset includes features like applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

### Important: 
- **Dataset Files**:
  - `train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv`: Training data used to build the model.
  - `test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv`: Test data used to evaluate the model.

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yajasarora/Loan-Prediction.git
